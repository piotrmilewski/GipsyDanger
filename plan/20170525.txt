Plan for 

1. Which jobs are most crucial?

We need to get the MVP to work, but perlin noise still prove to be confusing to understand and implement, though the other classes should not be a problem.

2. Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?

It is the same as yesterday's.

3. Which components are prerequisites for others?

It is the same as yesterday's, priority is to get MVP to work before moving onto more advanced implementations.

4. Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?

All members can work on getting at least the MVP to work, as communication is key while we are all present in class.
