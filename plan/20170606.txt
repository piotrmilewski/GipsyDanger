Team GipsyDanger: Piotr Milewski, Levi Olevsky, Edwin Mok
APCS2 pd5
Plan for 06-06-17

1. Which jobs are most crucial?

Since this is the last day of being able to work on the project, we feel like getting weapons to work would be crucial and would definitely help a lot in the calculations in battle.

2. Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?

Getting basic weapons would constitute as a core functionality because it is just the way the actual game works, weapons being a major part of methods such as attack() and other methods that require calculations.

3. Which components are prerequisites for others?

Getting the basic weapons and their stats to complete the formulas that we used to determine the specific player stats that were not instantiate earlier.

4. Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
Piotr can keep on working on Maps and Driver, and Levi and Edwin can work together on implementing buttons and other additional features possible.
