Team GipsyDanger: Piotr Milewski, Levi Olevsky, Edwin Mok
APCS2 pd5
Plan for 2017/05/22

1. Which jobs are most crucial?

One of the priorities now is getting perlin noise to work, though we are still unsure of how it functions. 

2. Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?

We would need to be able to generate a character and an enemy and allow for combat to happen, simply by using attack() method and reducing opponent's HP.

3. Which components are prerequisites for others?

The components required for the MVP would be prerequisites for others because the functionality can be further expanded after the completion of the MVP.

4. Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?

Perlin noise would require a group understanding of how it functions, as it is very difficult for one person to try to implement it by himself.
