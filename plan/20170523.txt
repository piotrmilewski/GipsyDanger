Team GipsyDanger: Piotr Milewski, Levi Olevsky, Edwin Mok
APCS2 pd5
Plan for 5-23-17

1. Which jobs are most crucial?

A flowchart and a UML Diagram are the most important elements of our project at the moment, as it can help us visualize how the game is supposed to work.

2. Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?

It is the same as yesterday's plan.

3. Which components are prerequisites for others?

It is the same as yesterday's as we would need to at least have MVP to go onto the next step.

4. Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?

We can split the work into parts, as Piotr and Edwin can work on the flowchart together and Levi can work on the UML Diagram for the Heroes superclass to be used to define the characters.
