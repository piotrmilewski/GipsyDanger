Plan for 06-01-17

1. Which jobs are most crucial?

We would need to instantiate stats for characters, as well as allow for characters to get into combat with each other as they interact

2. Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?

Allowing for characters to get into combat would be the core functionality since our MVP would at least have to allow for two characters to battle each other. 

3. Which components are prerequisites for others?

Instantiating stats for characters will be prerequisites for combat because there will be formulas to determine how the characters will attack.

4. Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?

We can split the roles to instantiate character stats, and working on the driver, since then we would not have merge conflicts and we can use our time more wisely.
